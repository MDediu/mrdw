Questions are great communication. When you ask, you identify the exact hole in comprehension or gap in perspective and request it from the knowledgeable party while simultaneously testing your current perspective, or model, of the conceptual mechanics of the topic at hand. The answers to direct questions are left with little room for rhetoric, subjectivity, and other expressional cruft and since the response to a good question is usually significant information, we find that the favorability towards questions is proportional to the depth of knowledge and an evasion of questions is a red flag for vapidity. 

We only ask the questions that we believe are relevant to us. This is why questions are so powerful; they represent a lack in one’s perspective and itch to complete it. So it follows that answers to questions represents desired (and therefore valuable) information. And the question, as the key to these valuable answers, is lauded by intellectually honest people.

The flip side of this is that we often only ask questions to fix the bugs and polish the ugly details of our conceptual models of reality (also known as our perspectives). This is the tricky bias of asking questions. We ask what we expect to help us complete our beautiful, carefully crafted models of the world and ignore those that would break them further, reveal a deep structural problem, suggest other people have nicer models, or suggest it is too complicated to bother building a model.

There is more subjectivity in that we expect there to be an answer (its necessary to a beautiful final form to our model) and often we are happy to take an answer that is only a small piece of the whole or just an easy to hold in your head<sup>*</sup> answer as it fits so well into our model, like cutting corners because we don’t want to admit how far we are from finished. 

As intellectually honest people, we want to eliminate all bias and converge on the most clear and objective perspective. So how do we go about evading this bias? A simple solution to start with is to ask those questions we are be afraid to answer. They are nearly always going to break your model. 

This model is the scaffold of our worldview; the engine that drives us in the direction of our lives. It’s difficult to admit after several years you might have been looking at the map upside down. And much like the strain of exercising our unused muscles makes us stronger, asking those questions about our reality which reveal our ignorance builds our maturity. This model of reality is built a little more each, tacking on pieces here and there and making connections as we learn. The intellectually ambitious want the shiny German engineered spectacle of a model that operates like a well oiled machine, comprehensive, internally consistent, and powerful yet light and efficient serving as the foundation to achieving our most ambitious goals by allowing us to approach and comprehend all life will throw. The most powerful machines are built meticulously, each part carefully crafted and selected for its unique place, we must approach the construction of our internal models the same way.
