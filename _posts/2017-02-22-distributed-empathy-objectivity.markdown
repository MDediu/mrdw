thesaurus.com's top three synonyms for objective are detached, disinterested, and dispassionate. It seems our net perspective on objectivity manifests notions of ruthless leaders and indifferent judges who are neglectful of the feelings and perspectives of pitiful individuals.

There is a selective bias against objectivity because the good things built on objectivity get the credit for it and then disassociate. Like a nerd who helps all the popular kids with their homework. They accept praise never mentioning how much they owe to help. These are the conceptual upper crust of fairness, justice, discipline and composure and whenever someone lauds their essential role in humanity they neglect to give credit to the objectivity that people need to manifest these concepts into reality.

Even worse, thesaurus.com gives objective as a synonym to indifferent and indifferent as an antonym to empathetic. Implying a linguistic consensus around the notion of objectivity on the other side of the conceptual demarcations as empathy. However, objectivity is the ability to approximate the perspective of a detached third party, to envision a nonexistent party and then empathize them. If you can empathize with a hypothetical individual you can certainly relate to the people you know.

Zoom out of society to ten thousand feet and consider the lives and perspectives of seven billion people you have never met, each with their own personal history, idiosyncrasies, complexities, and struggles. Right now as your read this people are being tortured to death, experiencing their last 5 seconds alive, the worst and best moments of their existence, there is even someone coming to the same conclusions expressed here by another means. You can try to simultaneously empathize with the whole world and you will inevitably, in that moment, have a harder time empathizing the perspectives of those your are close to. A trade-off between the quality and quantity of your empathetic abilities. But you are not making fewer connections you are spreading your empathetic capacity thinner, to the people who donâ€™t happen to be in the orbit of your life and as you do this, you find yourself becoming more objective, hence the title.

Its not rational to regard your social circle like this. The people in the orbit of your life are orders of magnitude more important to the outcome of your own than people you have and never will meet. At the same time, we want to be fully objective so that we can fairly evaluate the components of our circumstances and make the best decisions. Ironically, we have to objectively decide to be unfair and biased to those around us.
